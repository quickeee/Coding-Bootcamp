The purpose of this personal project is to create the first full stack application as the coding-bootcamp suggests.
This particular project is a part from our team's project. The team's project is a platform that simple users post Tasks,
for example if someone wants a DJ for his party, he simply post a Task looking for a DJ. Then a professional user
search for the Tasks and bids the amount that he would like in order to complete the requested Task. The smaller bid, 
inside the deadline that the simple user sets, wins and take the Task. So a contract turns out between the simple user
that posted the Task and the professional user that won the biding. 

My part of this team project is the Tasks part, that manages the Tasks, creating, deleting, setting deadline, etc...
In order to complete this full stack web application the tools i used are:
*Eclipse - for the java coding part!
*JDBC- connect with the database!
*Servlets + Jsp - Connect the java part with front-end!

**Everywhere in this project we assume that the simple user that manages the Tasks is the simple user with ID 1.
**The Date types of the forms best work in google chrome that best supports HTML-5.
Thanks for you kind support!
